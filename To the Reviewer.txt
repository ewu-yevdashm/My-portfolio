Dear Reviewer:

These are two examples that I completed. One of them is in java and is the Dijkstra Algorithm. You will see specifics if you look at the code.

The other example is a C program. It is my recreation of the Unix shell. This shows I understand operating systems and have a deep understanding of coding.


Thanks for looking.
